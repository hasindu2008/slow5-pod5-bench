res2tsv.sh
----------
Converts the stderr output from benchmarking; that is

- stderr output from slow5_random, slow5_sequential or slow5_sequential_cxxpool
- *_err files produced by xpm.sh, bench.sh and benchmany.sh

into a tsv format.

For a description of the fields, see res2tsv.sh.

Usage:

	cat <stderr>... | ./res2tsv.sh

Example:

Convert all stderr files for slow5_sequential produced by bench.sh to a tsv
named 'seq.tsv'.

	cat *sequential_err | ./res2tsv.sh > seq.tsv

plot.sh
-------
Plot the tsv data given the y and x variables. The resulting png file is printed
to stdout. To view all valid y and x variables, see plot.sh.

Usage:

	./plot.sh <y> <x> <tsv>...

Examples:

Plot the total seconds vs number of threads and save the output.

	./plot.sh tot_sec thr in.tsv > out.png

Plot the average speed of data retrieval from memory (gigabytes per second) vs
the maximum batch size used, and save the output.

	./plot.sh disk_gps maxbat dox_seq.tsv mmap_seq.tsv > seq.png

diffrm.sh
---------
Diff files and if they are the same remove all except the first file.

Usage:

	./diffrm.sh <file1> <file2>...

geomseq.sh
----------
Print the geometric sequence from start to end with ratio r.

Usage:

	./geomseq.sh <start> <end> <r>

Example:

	./geomseq.sh 1 16 2

Output:
1
2
4
8
16

Example:

	./geomseq.sh 6 66 6

Output:
6
36
66

geomseqproc.sh
--------------
Print the geometric sequence with ratio 2 from 1 to the number of available
processing units.

Usage:

	./geomseqproc.sh
